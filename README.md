# CAP5771 - Assignment 2
## Author: Chris Cargill
This README.md file will explain how to properly run the code files for this assignment as well as the purpose of each script.
## File Rundown
`problem1.py`: this file covers Problem 1 and runs the SVM multi-label classification for the Scene dataset

`problem2.py`: this file covers Problem 2 and runs the K-Means clustering implementation for the Seeds dataset

`problem3.py`: this file covers Problem 3 and runs the Random Forest and four balancing techniques for the German Credit Card dataset
## Python Libraries
Make sure the following libraries are downloaded already:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
scipy
imblearn

To install these Python packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy imblearn
```
## Run the Code
Run the following code in the terminal for Questions #1-3:
```bash
py run1.py
py run2.py
py run3.py
```
As another option depending on the system:
```bash
python run1.py
python run2.py
python run3.py
```
The output in the terminal should produce the results for all three questions.
